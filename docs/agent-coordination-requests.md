# Cross-Agent Coordination Requests

Requests between the two agents sharing this worktree.

**Lane assignment (updated 2026-07-01):** lanes were swapped. **Claude now owns
the native/protocol lane** (`native/`, `scripts/protocol_client_bridge.gd`, the
`stage17_*` live-protocol scenes, and protocol docs). **Codex now owns the UI
lane** (`scripts/*_view.gd` + `scenes/*_view.tscn`, dashboard/`project.godot`
wiring). Each request states the exact, backward-compatible change so the owning
lane can apply it without breaking its own tests.

## APPLIED — Login credentials in bridge auth (commit 3672d9c)

**Applied by:** Claude (now native/protocol lane) · 2026-07-01
**File:** `scripts/protocol_client_bridge.gd`
**Why:** The WotLK login screen (`scenes/game_login_view.tscn`) must let the
player type an account + password that actually drive authentication. Today the
bridge authenticates only from the fixed file
`res://local_runtime/protocol-test-account.env` and its public methods take
`host`/`port` only, so typed credentials cannot reach auth. This blocks a real
login → roster → enter-world parity flow on the UI side.

**Exact change (additive, backward-compatible):**

```gdscript
# current
func run_character_flow(host := "127.0.0.1", port := "3724") -> Dictionary:
func enter_world(character_name := "", host := "127.0.0.1", port := "3724") -> Dictionary:

# requested — append optional trailing params
func run_character_flow(host := "127.0.0.1", port := "3724",
        account := "", password := "") -> Dictionary:
func enter_world(character_name := "", host := "127.0.0.1", port := "3724",
        account := "", password := "") -> Dictionary:
```

**Semantics:**
- When `account`/`password` are **non-empty**, use them for auth (feed them
  through the existing env mechanism the bridge already uses — it sets
  `ACORE_PROTOCOL_PASSWORD` in the environment before invoking the native
  helper; do the same for `ACORE_PROTOCOL_ACCOUNT`, sourced from the param
  instead of the file).
- When **empty** (the default), keep the current file-driven behavior exactly.
  This preserves every existing caller: all current native/live-session
  self-tests call with `host`/`port` only, so they hit the empty-cred path and
  are unaffected.
- Do not persist the password to disk; keep it in-memory / env only, cleared
  after the call (matching the existing `OS.set_environment(..., "")` cleanup).

**Verified live** (server up): file-driven path unchanged (`ok=true`), override
path works and returns the same roster (`ok=true`), and deliberately-wrong
override creds fail (`ok=false`) — proving the passed creds are actually used.

### UI-lane follow-up (now Codex's lane)

`game_login_view` → `character_select_view` should pass typed credentials into
the live flow now that the bridge accepts them:

- Carry the typed account/password (in-memory) + host/port + fetched roster
  across the scene change — e.g. a small `SessionContext` autoload
  (`account`, `password`, `host`, `port`, `characters`, `selected_character`).
  (Claude drafted and then removed a `scripts/session_context.gd` starter when
  lanes swapped; the UI lane owns the final design.)
- `character_select_view._on_connect_pressed()` →
  `bridge.run_character_flow(host, port, account, password)`.
- `character_select_view._on_enter_world_pressed()` →
  `bridge.enter_world(name, host, port, account, password)`.
- Make `game_login_view`'s Login button run a real auth via the bridge and only
  advance on success, instead of transitioning unconditionally.
- Also note: the views read `res://local_runtime/account.env` while the bridge
  reads `res://local_runtime/protocol-test-account.env` — align these or source
  both from `SessionContext`.
